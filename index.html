        <p>"Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.
        Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing."</p>

        <h2>PHP</h2>
        <img src="images/php.png" alt="picture of php icon">
        <p>"PHP is a popular programming language used for web development within the confines of HTML. The PHP language can create dynamic web page content or images used on websites or elsewhere. Students who learn to code in PHP will be able to collect form data, generate dynamic page content, send and receive cookies, and much more.
        Intel, Metal Toad, and OpenSesame are all Portland companies that use PHP and have hired Epicodus graduates in the past."</p>

          <img src="images/design.png" alt="picture of design icon">
          <p>"Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web Design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces."</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <img src="images/css.png" alt="picture of CSS icon">
          <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual and aural layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.</p>
